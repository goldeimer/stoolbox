### Advantages & Disadvantages of Composting/Dry Toilets


There are many reasons why dry toilets make more sense in some places than their flush or chemical counterparts. Dry toilets don't require plumbing or chemical sanitation additives. Not only do they save a lot of resources, but they also allow you to turn your body waste into nutrient-rich soil, which you can use as fertilizer for ornamental plants and fruit trees or shrubs. Sounds like a win-win situation? It is. Nutrients that are important for plants are not disposed of, but made usable for the garden - through composting. We explain how to do that here. [Link zum How To Kompostierung].

### What is a dry toilet and how does it work? 

You already know how a toilet works. It isn’t different from a dry toilet. You do your business, take toilet paper and wipe your butt as you go, throw the toilet paper into the toilet and sprinkle it with litter. A variety of organic and natural materials are suitable for use as bedding. Some more - some less. The bedding is mainly used to reduce odors, to visually cover what is left behind, and is the equivalent of a toilet cistern - only (as the name suggests) without any water.

Speaking of water. Clean drinking water flows through our toilet flushes. With an average of 6 - 11 daily trips to the toilet, this accounts for about 30% of your daily drinking water needs. The wastewater is separated and treated in wastewater treatment plants - making dry toilets much more resource-efficient.

There are basically two types of dry toilets - dry separation toilets or simple bucket toilets without separation.  In dry separation toilets, urine is collected separately in the front area and the poop, including litter and toilet paper, in the rear area. In the "one-pot" versions, everything goes into one container together.

When the container is full, the leftovers are composted and nutrient-rich humus is produced, which is returned to the soil and plants. So the important nutrients are kept in the cycle

### Application examples    

Dry toilets are super useful in small gardens, on the road and everywhere where there is no water and sewage connection. They don't need flushing water, no chemicals and, if treated properly, they also make a really good fertilizer that your soil and plants will love. Along the way, you'll close the natural nutrient cycle and do your garden and the environment a big favor.

#### Small/urban garden

You are allowed to compost dry toilet contents in your garden, as long as the use of dry toilets is not explicitly prohibited and it is not located in a water protection area. This is the case in only a few gardens. In most, dry toilets are very welcomed and many gardeners have been using them for decades. However, you must make sure that your compost pile does not pose a danger to people or the environment. In any case, make sure that no liquid from the compost can seep into the soil and feel free to ask your allotment club or state association if you are unsure about anything.

We generally recommend composting dry toilet contents in separate composters. Also, you should use the compost produced only to improve the soil in beds for ornamental plants, on fruit trees or fruit bushes. Thus, you avoid possible hygiene risks from suboptimal composting. Either way, you're helping to close nutrient cycles with composting.

We excrete pathogens through our feces and much of the drug residues through our urine. Pathogens are killed during composting. Drug residues are also broken down when the  composting process is done in a professional way, with an adequate, often longer composting time.   In the garden, however, we do not have ideal conditions every time we compost. So if you suffer from an infection or need to take a lot of medication, you should avoid recycling dry toilet contents and choose the disposal route.

#### On the road

You can use your dry toilet on a houseboat, in a camping van, or in another place where you don't have a composting option. Even if you're not recycling nutrients - the dry toilet makes sense for you. Either because you don't want to use your water supply in the bus for flushing, appreciate the self-sufficiency of dry toilets, or don't want to use a chemical toilet for other reasons.

#### Public space

Goldeimer has been on the road for many years with mobile dry toilets at major events such as music festivals to demonstrate an alternative to water and chemical toilets. In addition, some cities already have public dry toilets.

Moreover, dry toilets offer a way to provide sanitation in places where there is no sewerage system or generally no adequate use of water, such as in some countries of the Global South or in the context of temporary disaster and emergency relief.
