# Fermentation & Composting

 Your dry toilet is full and you are ready to safely and professionally recycle your waste in the compost until nature makes humus soil out of it again? In this chapter, you'll learn how fermentation and composting work.


## What do we recycle?

If you use your dry toilet without a separating insert, then all solid and liquid components of the toilet are in the same bucket. Here it is especially important to use enough bedding during usage. The contents of the bucket must not float, but have a solid consistency.


> There are different types of bedding that can be used (e.g. straw meal, bark mulch, sawdust, ash, etc.), but they differ in their properties. For the production of high quality fertilizer, such as Terra Preta and similar substrates, the choice of litter is game-changing and must include the following ingredients, among others: Vegetable charcoal, rock flour, effective microorganisms and Co. Such vegetable charcoal bedding mixtures are also available ready to buy 
(e.g. Goldeimer [Kackpulver](https://goldeimer.de/products/kackpulver)). They contain all the necessary and helpful ingredients in the right proportions.

If you use a dry separation toilet, i.e. a dry toilet with a separating insert, then you will have a bucket with solids (poop, toilet paper and bedding in a compostable bag) and a canister/bucket with urine and, and sometimes, period fluid.

## Am I allowed to do this at all?

As a general rule, you must always make sure that your compost pile does not pose a danger to people or the environment. Make sure that no liquid from the compost can seep into the soil.

We generally recommend that you compost dry toilet contents in separate composters. In addition, you should only use the compost produced to improve the soil in beds for ornamental plants, on fruit trees or fruit bushes, in order to avoid a possible hygiene risk due to suboptimal composting. Either way, you're helping to close nutrient cycles with composting.

We excrete pathogens through our feces and much of the drug residues through our urine. Pathogens are killed during composting. Drug residues are also broken down in a professional composting process that is long enough. In the garden, however, we do not have ideal conditions every time we compost. So if you suffer from an infection or have to take a lot of medication, you should refrain from recycling dry toilet contents and choose the disposal route.

In German small gardens, you are allowed to compost dry toilet contents as long as the use of dry toilets is not explicitly prohibited and your allotment is not located in a water protection area. Most of the time the use of dry toilets is very welcome and many gardeners have been using them for decades. If you are not sure about something, please ask your allotment garden association or your national federation.

## Dry toilets and composting

Composting is a natural process in which organic material such as green waste, kitchen waste or even contents from dry toilets is broken down by (micro-) biological activity. The aim of composting is to create ideal living conditions for these microorganisms. In the long term, spreading nutrient-rich composted material in the soil builds up a healthy, living humus layer that can regenerate itself and remain fertile for a long time. In this way, we close the nutrient cycle and contribute to soil health. Composting is divided into three phases. The WHO recommends a minimum of two years for the entire composting process.

### Phase 1: Preparation and collection of material

Use a closed composter so that animals and children cannot come into contact with the material and rainwater cannot enter. Put on rubber gloves first. Before you first fill the composter with dry toilet content, sprinkle in shredded, woody, shrubby, and straw materials as a base. Now gently pour the dry toilet contents into the composter and cover it with green waste and other biomass. If needed, you can use a pitchfork to spread the green waste. Don't forget to carefully wash or sanitize your hands after filling the composter.

The liquid urine from your dry separation toilet can also be added to the regular green waste compost. Make sure that there is already enough absorbent material in the composter so that nothing can seep into the soil. Otherwise, mix the urine with sufficient litter beforehand (e.g. with Goldeimer Kackpulver). This has the advantage that you can also use the nutrients from your urine for your vegetable patch.

In German small gardens the spreading of fresh urine is actually not allowed. If you still want to use the urine in liquid form, we have more tips in the section "Utilization of urine" on how to minimize any hygiene risks beforehand.

Duration of the phase: Until composter is filled or gardening season is over

Equipment needed: Closed composter, sturdy rubber gloves, pitchfork, disinfectant, grass clippings or leaves.


### Phase 2: Rotting


Once your composter is full, it's on to Phase 2. The rotting process lasts six months and takes place in the same closed composter. Your work is done for now and the microorganisms get to work. Temperatures of at least 55Â°C develop in the thermal composter.

If you want to monitor the temperature, you can buy a simple prick thermometer and stick it into the compost. Don't be surprised - the microorganisms in the upper, fresh layers need a few days to become active initially. Then the temperature should rise. After 12 weeks, almost only the ambient temperature will be reached.

Duration of the phase: At least 6 months from the last filling (over the winter the phase lasts longer).


### Phase 3: The humification

After at least 6 months in the rotting chamber, the material is moved to a separate compost pile - or, in the case of larger amounts, to a heap (elongated pile). The material is well mixed during this process. The compost should not exceed a height of 1 m and should be in contact with the soil so that soil organisms such as earthworms or woodlice can continue to decompose as unhindered as possible. Cover the compost with a compost fleece. Foil is unsuitable because it allows too little oxygen to pass through. The process of composting takes about 18 months. Use gloves for these steps as well and clean them afterwards. Also disinfect your hands after work is done or wash thoroughly with soap.

Duration of the phase: 18 months

Equipment needed: Open composter, wheelbarrow, pitchfork or shovel, gloves, compost fleece, disinfectant


### What is important in composting?

Successful composting and sanitation is not rocket science. However, you do need to keep a close eye on the process. We will help you with that!

1. The ideal composition and type of starting materials

The mixing ratio is an important point of control. Aim to a mixing ratio of about 25% dry toilet content and 75% green waste mixture (grass clippings, leaves, etc.) and layer the whole thing like a lasagna. Every time you put some shitty content, put three times the amount of green waste on top. Here, it's important to use a mix of shredded, shrubby, straw and woody material, fresh green and lawn clippings, and some kitchen scraps. The mixing ratio should always be adjusted according to the available raw materials and consistency of the dry bedding.

2. Permanent and sufficient oxygen supply

The microorganisms and soil organisms present in the compost need air to breathe. Therefore, make sure that you add enough structuring material - e.g. small branches or straw - to the compost mixture.

Important thing after lawn mowing: Do not pile up all the grass cuttings in one layer or in one corner. The material will stick together after a few days, preventing oxygen from circulating. So always mix  the grass clippings well with material that promotes oxygenation.

3. The humidity

The compost should not be too moist or too dry. Both are uncomfortable conditions for microorganisms. Therefore, always make sure to add some absorbent material to the compost if you are adding urine.

If necessary, you can mix the urine with bedding (e.g.  Goldeimer Kackpulver) before adding it. If there is too much moisture in the composter, straw or other dry material will help.

As a general rule, it is better to make the compost pile a little too dry than too wet.

4. Mineral substance

An addition of mineral substance (e.g. clay or rock flour) has a positive effect on humus formation. Therefore, rock flour is already included in the gold bucket of Kackpulver. The mineral substances have a particularly large surface area. This improves the water storage capacity of the compost, provides suitable habitat for necessary microorganisms and promotes the formation of clay-humus complexes. Sandy material has a lower impact than rock flour.

5. Constant attention

If you notice rotting odors, something has gone wrong. Take another close look at the process and consider where adjustments are needed. Is there too much or too little oxygen coming into the compost? Is the water content right? Is the amount of readily available carbon from green waste and straw too low? Is there too much woody material? Too much grass clippings sticking together and cutting off the oxygen supply?

## Make Terra Preta yourself through fermentation


> Terra Preta is one of the most fertile soils in the world. Its secret lies in the high proportion of biochar and a balanced mixture of biomass (e.g. kitchen waste, manure, human feces) and mineral components such as bone or clay, which is broken down or stabilized by microorganisms and soil animals. Terra Preta can store large amounts of nutrients and water, creates ideal conditions for soil organisms, and allows fertilization to occur naturally as needed. Plants become less susceptible to pests and you can do without the addition of artificial fertilizers in the long term.

If you want to make  humus fertilizer Ã  la Terra Preta, then you need to ferment your dry toilet contents. Important detail: Fermentation is not a substitute for composting. Composting always takes place afterwards.

Fermentation with the right bedding offers many advantages: First of all, acid sanitization (pH-value of about 4) occurs in this process, and on the other hand, nutrients are bound to biochar and rock flour in the litter. This means that the nutrients are available to the plants for a long time after application and can thus be optimally used by them.

> Why is biochar needed for the production of Terra Preta? Biochar has a huge surface area and is perfect for the stable storage of nutrients and water - and therefore also as a habitat for microorganisms. Imagine a sponge that can't be squeezed, but as it ferments, soaks up nutrients, making it a paradise for microbiological life. Another kind of bedding is not a permanent habitat for microorganisms, but food for them. This is why wood chips and straw meal are simply metabolized in the soil by microorganisms and soil organisms after application. Biochar remains in the soil for centuries as an almost permanent luxury habitat.


### How do I ferment dry toilet contents?

Fermentation is an anaerobic process. This means it takes place in the absence of oxygen. Effective microorganisms (EM) are necessary for a successful fermentation. These are already in the Goldeimer âKackpulverâ and in a concentrated form also in the Goldeimer EMs. The microorganisms steer the process in the right direction. If no EMs were added, undesirable and harmful rot would be the result. In order for the fermentation to work correctly, you should regularly use biochar-bedding each time you go to the bathroom. Don't skimp on the amount here, if the mixture is too moist, this can also lead to rotting. At the beginning it is easier if you collect the urine separately with a separating insert and do not ferment it. In addition, our recommendation is to have a spray bottle with EM in order to be able to make adjustments if you notice rot or urine smell in the bucket.


### Phase 1: Preparation

First, put on rubber gloves. Spray the contents of the dry toilet with effective microorganisms (EM) one last time. If you are using compostable bags (such as Goldeimer SchietbÃ¼del) in the dry toilet, close the bag and gently press it into the bucket, which you then close tightly with the sealing lid. Make sure that the lid is properly closed, because no oxygen should get into the bucket.

Place the sealed bucket in a place where it can enjoy room temperature for the entire duration of the fermentation, if possible. The microorganisms feel comfortable at 17-22Â°C, but also at higher temperatures (e.g. at 30-35Â°C in a heating cellar). The most important thing is that the temperature remains fairly constant and no freezing temperatures prevail. While your waste is fermenting in this bucket, use a second bucket to keep your dry toilet functioning.

Time required: 5 minutes
Equipment needed: Sturdy rubber gloves, lid for the bucket, effective microorganisms (EM), toilet bucket, disinfectant.


### Phase 2: Fermentation

For this phase you need, above all, patience. Fermentation lasts 3-6 weeks, depending on the conditions. Check every now and then if the process is going as desired. If you want to further optimize the fermentation, it is recommended to spray 3-5 pumps of the effective microorganisms (EM) once in a while and then close the lid airtight. You can also add more carbohydrates as food for the lactic acid bacteria. Syrup is best, but sugar works too. Simply dissolve 1 tablespoon of syrup in 0.5 liters of warm water, allow to cool, and spray on with an old spray bottle. A few pumps are enough.

Usually a white fuzz of yeast bacteria forms on the surface. This is exactly what you want. However, if a green turf of mold spreads, something went wrong with the fermentation process. In the end, the mixture should have a slight fungal smell like a wet forest. Once the fermentation is successfully completed, gently empty the contents of the bucket into your quick composter to go through phase 1 of composting. Wear your gloves again for the dumping process and disinfect them afterwards. Also disinfect your hands.

Duration of the phase: 3-6 weeks

Equipment needed: Sturdy rubber gloves, disinfectant.


## Usage of urine

When freshly out of our bodies,  urine is germ-free  and at the same time contains most of the nutrients we excrete, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. These are the most important plant nutrients. Humans therefore excrete a kind of liquid fertilizer - and you can easily use this with a separating insert for your dry toilet.

In German small gardens, composting of liquid urine or urine-enriched bedding is allowed; however, direct use of non-composted liquid urine is usually not permitted. Many gardeners nevertheless mix some pee into the irrigation water every now and then. If you are not ill and do not take any medication, this is quite harmless, regardless of the situation.


### Sanitization of urine

The WHO recommends storing urine for six months in a closed container, such as a discarded 20-liter water can. The enzyme urease ensures that a degradation process starts in the urine, during which the pH value shifts to an alkaline environment. If your urine contains germs, they will be killed because they cannot survive in the alkaline pH range.

To avoid ammoniac formation in the canister, you can start a fermentation. For each liter of urine, mix two tablespoons of syrup or sugar and two tablespoons of effective microorganisms (EM) in the canister. Alternate the syrup and urine and swirl until the canister is filled. A side effect of this fermentation is that the urine contains more nitrogen in a plant-available form, making it a better fertilizer. If the fermentation is successful, it will smell slightly sour. If something goes wrong, there will be a pungent urine smell. With a little more syrup and EM, you can readjust.


### Composting with urine

When you mix your urine with Goldeimer âKackpulverâ, you can simply add the contents to your regular green waste compost. The mixture must be composted for at least six months to sanitize it. The urine-enriched biochar in the âKackpulverâ is a wonderful aggregate for composting. The finished compost will have a higher nutrient content.

## Using it in the garden

Next you can find out what you can do with the ensuing fertilizers. The indications are rough guidelines. Remember to consider the soil fertility, the level of nutrient supply in your garden and, of course, the plants you want to feed when you make your choice which fertilizer to use.

By incorporating compost into it, the soil gradually acquires a higher humus content. This is important for all soil organisms (such as bacteria, algae, fungi, woodlice or earthworms), but also for soil fertility and the needed supply of nutrients to the plants. It is equally important to ensure that - especially in the growing season - more readily available nutrients are added in the form of NPK fertilizer made out of your urine.

Important: Follow the sanitation guidelines we provide in the chapters "Dry toilets and composting", "Making your own Terra Preta through fermentation" and "Usage of urine". Humus fertilizer from composted feces should be applied only to ornamental plant beds, fruit trees and fruit bushes, and not in horticultural beds.

### Spreading the compost

Before  spring starts (i.e., about two weeks before seeding or planting begins), your finished  shit-compost should be distributed and incorporated into the top 5 cm of soil. If you have composted the contents from your dry toilet without fermentation, you can apply up to eight liters per square meter. For compost with admixtures from fermentation or urine-soaked litter, as little as four liters per square meter will suffice.


### Application of urine

If you have collected urine in liquid form, you can also fertilize during the growing season. To do this, you should dilute the urine with water in a ratio of 1:20 and then water with the mixture every two weeks. Four weeks before the harvest you should not fertilize with urine anymore.
