# Why Open-Source-Hardware

There are many reasons why we want to develop open-source hardware dry toilets. Some of them are:

|  |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Community | Open-source hardware is created and improved by a community of developers working towards a common goal of creating high-quality hardware.|
| Transparency | Open-source hardware is open and transparent. Anyone can access and understand the source code or blueprint and how the hardware works. |
| Collaboration | Open-source hardware enables developers to collaborate and share their skills and ideas to create better hardware. |
| Innovation | Open-source hardware promotes innovation as developers can easily introduce and test new ideas and technologies. |
| Freedom | Open-source hardware provides users with freedom to use, modify, and distribute the hardware freely.
| Cost | Open-source hardware can help lower the cost of accessing high-quality hardware as the production and distribution of proprietary hardware often comes with high costs.
